  "body": "### Welcome to FredBoat Docs\r\nWelcome to the FredBoat docs. FredBoat is an open-source general-purpose bot developed in Java. The bot is based off of [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and was created by (@Frederikam). You'll be able to get a link back to this website simply by invoking `;;help`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I am also developing FredBoat♪♪ **which is in beta** and is a music bot. This is a seperate bot and must therefore be invited using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot). See the commands below on how to use it.\r\n\r\n## Setting up the bot\r\nGetting FredBoat running on your server is simple. You can invite the bot by authenticating it with your account using [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=168686772216135681&scope=bot) link. Bear in mind that you must have `Manage Server` permissions to be able to do this. \r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n| Command                    | Description                                                           | Example usage                               |\r\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\r\n| ;;help                     | Sends a PM with instructions and a link to this site                  |                                             |\r\n| ;;say \\<text\\>             | Make the bot echo something                                           | ;;say test                                  |\r\n| ;;avatar                   | Displays the avatar of a user                                         | ;;avatar @Frederikam                        |\r\n| ;;brainfuck \\<code\\> [input] | Executes [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) code  | ;;brainfuck ,.+.+. a                        |\r\n| ;;lua \\<code\\>             | Executes Lua code                                                     | ;;lua print(\"Hello, world!\")                |\r\n| ;;riot \\<text\\>            | ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ Hello, world! ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ                                          | ;;riot Hello, world!                        |\r\n| ;;lenny                    | ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)                                                              |                                             |\r\n| ;;leet \\<text\\>            | m@k3$ y0u 50Und l1k3 a 5cr1p7 k1dd13                                  | ;;leet makes you sound like a script kiddie |\r\n| ;;mal \\<search term\\>      | Searched MyAnimeList for animes and users                             | ;;mal re:zero                               |\r\n| ;;dump \\<1-2000\\>          | Dumps between 1 and 2000 messages to [Hastebin](http://hastebin.com/) | ;;dump 1000                                 |\r\n| ;;facedesk                 | Uploads an image                                                      | ;;facedesk                                  |\r\n| ;;roll                     | Uploads an image                                                      | ;;roll                                      |\r\n\r\n## Music Commands\r\n[(Requires the music bot)](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot).\r\n\r\n| Command                    | Description                                                           | Example usage                               |\r\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\r\n| ;;play \\<url\\>             | Plays music from the given URLs.

The bot will not be able to play songs blocked in the US (usually from copyright infringements on YouTube).\r\n\r\n**Examples of supported sites:**\r\n* YouTube\r\n* Soundcloud\r\n* Google Drive\r\n* Dropbox\r\n* Twitch\r\n* Vimeo\r\n\r\n**[Full list of supported sites](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)**\r\n\r\n(Note: Some of these may not work)\r\n\r\n## Join FredBoat Hangout!\r\nWe invite everyone to join FredBoat hangout, which is a place to discuss suggestions and request for support. I'm very willing to take suggestions for the bot so don't hesitate to say what you have in mind!
