  "body": "# Welcome to FredBoat Docs\r\nWelcome to the FredBoat docs. FredBoat is an open-source general-purpose bot developed in Java. The bot is based off of [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and was created by (@Frederikam). You'll be able to get a link back to this website simply by invoking `;;help`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I am also developing FredBoat♪♪ **which is in beta** and is a music bot. This is a seperate bot and must therefore be invited using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot). See the commands below on how to use it.\r\n\r\n## Setting up the bot\r\nGetting FredBoat running on your server is simple. You can invite the bot by authenticating it with your account using [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=168686772216135681&scope=bot) link. Bear in mind that you must have `Manage Server` permissions to be able to do this. \r\n\r\n## Setting up the music bot\r\nThe music bot has it's own [invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n| Command                    | Description                                                           | Example usage                               |\r\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\r\n| ;;help                     | Sends a PM with instructions and a link to this site                  |                                             |\r\n| ;;say \\<text\\>             | Make the bot echo something                                           | ;;say test                                  |\r\n| ;;avatar                   | Displays the avatar of a user                                         | ;;avatar @Frederikam                        |\r\n| ;;brainfuck \\<code\\> [input] | Executes [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) code  | ;;brainfuck ,.+.+. a                        |\r\n| ;;lua \\<code\\>             | Executes Lua code                                                     | ;;lua print(\"Hello, world!\")                |\r\n| ;;riot \\<text\\>            | ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ Hello, world! ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ                                          | ;;riot Hello, world!                        |\r\n| ;;lenny                    | ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)                                                              |                                             |\r\n| ;;leet \\<text\\>            | m@k3$ y0u 50Und l1k3 a 5cr1p7 k1dd13                                  | ;;leet makes you sound like a script kiddie |\r\n| ;;mal \\<search term\\>      | Searched MyAnimeList for animes and users                             | ;;mal re:zero                               |\r\n| ;;dump \\<1-2000\\>          | Dumps between 1 and 2000 messages to [Hastebin](http://hastebin.com/) | ;;dump 1000                                 |\r\n| ;;facedesk                 | Uploads an image                                                      | ;;facedesk                                  |\r\n| ;;roll                     | Uploads an image                                                      | ;;roll                                      |\r\n\r\n## Music Commands\r\n[(Requires the music bot)](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot).\r\n\r\n| Command                    | Description                                                           | Example usage                               |\r\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\r\n| ;;play \\<url\\>             | Plays music from the given URLs.

If using a playlist, please bear in mind that you cannot use a playlist with more than 20 entries. The bot will not be able to play songs blocked in the US (usually from copyright infringements on YouTube).\r\n\r\n## Adding music to the playlist\r\nAdding music to the playlist is pretty simple. To start playing a song, simply use the ;;play command. Here are two examples:\r\n```\r\n;;play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\r\n;;play rick roll\r\n```\r\nYou can either explicitly state the URL, or you can get the bot to search YouTube and give you some choices. Here's an example response:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPlease select a video with the ';;select n' command:\r\n1: Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (03:33)\r\n2: YOUTUBERS REACT TO RICKROLL (Ep. #5) (09:20)\r\n3: I Rick Roll My Entire Chemistry Class! (05:55)\r\n4: The New Rick Roll! (04:26)\r\n5: Melania Trump's RNC RICKROLL (00:19)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then choose your song with the `;;select <number>` command.\r\n\r\n**Supported sites:**\r\n* YouTube\r\n* SoundCloud (single tracks only)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want other sites supported. \r\n\r\n## (Very) Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n### How do I play music with the bot?\r\nPlease read this fine manual. Specifically the part with the music commands.\r\n\r\n### How do I add an entire playlist to the queue?\r\nSimply link a playlist with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n```;;play <url-to-playlist>```\r\n\r\nThe bot will only load the first 20 songs to reduce delays.\r\n\r\n### How do I restrict music commands to a specific channel or role?\r\nThe bot will only listen to music commands invoked in channels it can actually **write** to. Simply override it such that the music bot can only talk in the channels you want the bot to be usable from.\r\n\r\nIf you want to restrict the bot to a specific role, you can always just restrict the bot to a channel only accessible by a specific set of roles.\r\n\r\n### How do I self host the bot?\r\nIt's difficult. I do not advise it.\r\n\r\n### Why is the music bot slow to respond to commands?\r\nLots of people are using the music bot 24/7 on a relatively cheap server. I'm currently working on setting up a Patreon campaign to allow me to receive funding for additional hardware for the music bot. The music quality shuld be fine for the most part though. \r\n\r\n### The music bot is telling me it doesn't have permission to connect/play music. How do I give it permission?\r\nYou are trying to play music in a voice channel, but your __Discord server permissions__ prevents it from connecting or speaking. You would need to change the permissions of the channel to allow the bot to connect and speak, as you would do with a user. For official help on this topic, see [Discord's support center](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707).\r\n\r\n## Join FredBoat Hangout!\r\nWe invite everyone to join FredBoat hangout, which is a place to discuss suggestions and request for support. I'm very willing to take suggestions for the bot so don't hesitate to say what you have in mind!
